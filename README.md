# HireReady – AI-Powered Resume Builder (Work in Progress)

> ⚠️ This project is currently under active development. Expect rough edges and ongoing feature integration.

**HireReady** is an AI-powered, web-based platform that helps users build professional, optimized resumes tailored to specific job roles. We aim to simplify the resume creation process using intuitive UI and intelligent suggestions powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Project Status

This is a **mini project** for the _Artificial Intelligence Lab_ (T.E. CMPN – Semester V).  
We're currently building the frontend pages and planning the backend + AI integrations.

### Completed So Far

- Landing page (`index.html`)
- Resume info form with validation (`form.html`, `script.js`)
- Basic static layout for: About, Features, Pricing, Contact

### Coming Soon

- AI suggestions using NLP (via Flask backend + OpenAI/Mistral)
- Resume template selection & preview
- Resume-to-JD matching
- PDF export functionality
